            <p>I am Sonu Pal, a passionate and dedicated Software Developer with a strong foundation in Python, SQL, JavaScript, React.js and  Html & CSS.
                I recently completed my B.Tech in Computer Science (AIML) from Technocrats Institute of Technology, Bhopal, with a CGPA of 8.73.

                I have hands-on experience in building intelligent systems and web applications, 
                including an AI-powered Virtual Assistant and a React-based Tech Care Web Project. 
                My technical expertise extends to DBMS, OOP, logical reasoning, and problem-solving,
                and I have earned multiple certifications, including HackerRank Python (Pro) and SQL (Intermediate).

                Beyond coding, I enjoy sewing clothes, cooking, and running. I am always eager to learn new technologies 
                and contribute to innovative projects. Let's connect and collaborate! </p>
